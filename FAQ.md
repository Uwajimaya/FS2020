*Q*: I like the lights but prefer not to use the lens flare effects. What do I do?<br>
*A*: Go to ...\Packages\Community\Uwa light mod pack (v.X)\Effects\ and delete the TEXTURE folder. Done. Unfortunately you'll have to do this again with every new version.

Q: How do I use some of your mods but not all of them? How do I avoid the light mod conflicintg with another mod?<br>
A: Go to ...\Packages\Community\Uwa light mod pack (v.X)\SimObjects\Airplanes. You can either delete the folder for the aircraft that you don't want my mod for OR, you can go into the desired aircraft folder and rename the systems.cfg file to something else. That way, you can easily get the mod back by renaming it back to systems.cfg

Q: When using the default planws, I can see the landing light reflection when flying isnide clouds. Why I don't see that anymore after installing your mod?<br>
A: I changed that on purpose. If I leave that setting and make the lights brighter, flying outside of clouds looks like you're flying in fog.
