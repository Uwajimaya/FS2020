The lighting effects for many default aircraft are set too low partially because the same effects have to work for many different aircraft. In addition, some of the lighting systems is broken/not implmented, Asobo is reportedly working on a new system. No ETA.
<br>In the meantime, I am using the features that do exists to create customized lighting effects for each individual aircraft - landing lights, taxi lights, strobe, nav lights, etc. to hopefully provide a more realistic and immersive experience. Thanks for stopping by and have fun!

All updated aircraft files now available in one single package for easier download! Please delete any existing "Uwa light mods" folder(s) before installing the new pack!
