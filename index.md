## Uwa's lighting mods for MSFS

Latest release: [TBM930 lighting mod v1](https://github.com/Uwajimaya/FS2020/raw/2062ff8823843d0cc3085f4d61c23b125d46754b/TMB930%20Lighting%20update.zip)

Known issue: The spotlight, landing light, and strobe changes will apply to ALL current airplanes - but not overwrite any of their files! So far, people prefer those global changes but the next version will make it so that  changes will only apply to the aircaft for which the mod is for. This will allow each airplane to have different lighting behavior (e.g. slow pulsing beacon vs. quick flashing beacon)


Next in line:
- Cessna Citiation 4 (in progress)
- King Air
- Cessna Caravan
- and then we'll see...
