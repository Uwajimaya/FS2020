## Uwa's lighting mods for MSFS

The lighting effects for many default aircraft are set too low partially because the same effects have to work for many different aircraft. My mods provide lighting effect files for each aircraft individually - landing lights, taxi lights, strobe, nav lights, etc. to hopefully provide a more realistic and immersive experience.

Latest releases:

Sept. 9: [TBM930 light mod v1.1](https://github.com/Uwajimaya/FS2020/raw/master/Uwa%20light%20mod%20-%20TMB930v1.1.zip)
- lighting fx files no longer apply to all aircaft - only to the TBM

Sept. 9: [CJ4 light mod v1.0](https://github.com/Uwajimaya/FS2020/raw/master/Uwa%20light%20mod%20-%20CJ4.zip)


Next in line:
- King Air
- Cessna Caravan
- Cessna 150
- and then we'll see...
